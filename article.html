                Drone Appendages
            </h1>
            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Walgreens and a Google affiliate are testing drone deliveries that can put drugstore products on
                    customer doorsteps minutes after being ordered.</p>
                <p>Snacks like Goldfish Crackers or gummy bears as well as aspirin for sick kids will be delivered
                    starting next month in Christiansburg, Virginia, by a 10-pound (4.5-kilogram) drone flying as fast
                    as 70 miles (113 kilometers) per hour, the companies said Thursday.</p>
                <p>Customers will be able to order from a list of more than 100 items that includes individual consumer
                    goods and packages of products to help with things like coughs and colds, but not prescriptions.
                    They will place their order through a Wing app and then get delivery anywhere from five to 10
                    minutes afterward.

                    A drone capable of making a 12-mile (19-kilometer) round trip will fly to the delivery site, hover
                    and use a winch system to lower the package to the ground and leave it there. The drone will be run
                    by Wing Aviation LLC, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet Inc.

                    “We’re taking a 10-pound aircraft to move a three-pound package through the sky,” Wing CEO James
                    Ryan Burgess said. “It’s very light, very efficient.”</p>
                <p>Drone deliveries in the United States are still largely in early testing. Google announced in April
                    that Wing received federal approval to make commercial drone deliveries. It marked the first time a
                    company has gotten a federal drone delivery certification.

                    Online retail giant Amazon said in June that it plans to use self-piloted drones to deliver packages
                    to shoppers’ homes in the coming months.

                    United Parcel Service Inc. also said in July that it was setting up a subsidiary to expand its drone
                    deliveries, which are limited to transporting medical samples at a group of hospitals in Raleigh,
                    North Carolina.

                    Burgess told reporters Thursday that Wing and Walgreens had no timeframe for how long this test
                    would take or when consumers might expect widespread drone use.

                    “I think we still have a ways to go before it’s the norm in our transportation network,” he said.
